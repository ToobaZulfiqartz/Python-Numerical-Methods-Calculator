This project is a Python-based calculator that allows users to solve equations using different numerical methods such as:
- Bisection Method  
- Newton-Raphson Method  
- Secant Method  
- Raphson Newton Method

**Features**
- User can choose a method and equation type.
- Inputs constants and values.
- Produces accurate results for each selected method.
- Plots graphs to visualize the calculated results.
- Developed as part of the Computational Physics course.

**Tools Used**
- Python (numpy, matplotlib, and Tkinter for GUI)
